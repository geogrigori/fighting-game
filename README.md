#### Description: JavaScript Fighting Game with HTML Canvas: I started by learning how to code some basic fighting game mechanics. Started off with some rectangles that know how to fight each other, once these forms were ready I changed it into sprites with animations. Steps: project setup; created pklayer and enemy; moved caracters with event listeners; attack animations; health bar and game timer/game over.
